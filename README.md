• California Department of Finance (DOF) is the organization that which responsible for 
overseeing city-level financial planning and ensures that cities receive equitable funding 
based on their population size and financial needs.

population size.  
• The DOF department wants to analyze how city expenditures vary based on population 
size.

**Problem Statement:**
Are there significant differences in expenditure patterns between cities based on their 
population size?  
**Objectives:**
To determine how city expenditure differs based on population by comparing the total 
expenditures among cities of different sizes.  
**Initial hypothesis:** 
Cities with larger populations spend more overall to provide services, infrastructure, and 
resources for more people. 
**Model Planning:**
Build the linear regression model to analyze how population size influences city expenditure.
